Steps to Sponsor an Apprentice Ready to become a sponsor employer? Follow these 7 steps to success. Start your search through these channels: Connect with trade/industry associations or unions Reach out to your local secondary school; refer to our list of school districts offering SkilledTradesBC Youth in Trades Programs Contact Indigenous Skills and Employment Training service providers , First Nations band offices or Tribal Councils who can also connect you with prospective apprentices Advertise for openings on your website, job search websites or social media Employers: Ask your employees if they know someone who is interested in becoming an apprentice Once you\u2019ve found an apprentice, register as a sponsor by creating a SkilledTradesBC Portal account and fill out the registration form for your apprentice. You can expect confirmation of registration in ten business days. Alternatively, your apprentice can fill out the registration form from their Portal account. If so, you will receive a notification to review and approve their registration request within 30 days. Note : If you employ workers in a Skilled Trades Certification (Compulsory) trade , you will be prompted to complete a mandatory Employer Workforce Submission and provide information related to your workforce. As a sponsor\u2014and working with the employer, if applicable\u2014you are responsible for ensuring: Work together with the supervising journeyperson and apprentice to create a structured training plan. Search for the apprentice\u2019s trade using Find Your Trade and review the Program Outline (often near the middle of the page) to inform the training plan. As a sponsor, you must track your apprentice's hours on the job and report them through the SkilledTradesBC Portal regularly, ideally every three to six months. About 80 per cent of your apprentice\u2019s training time will be at work. One hour on the job is equal to one hour of work-based training. Your apprentice may accumulate work-based training hours while working for you and/or for another employer. Work-based training hours must be completed under the direct supervision of a certified or SkilledTradesBC-approved tradesperson. If you require additional staff members to help submit work-based training hours or manage your Portal account, make sure to assign the appropriate Portal user roles to ensure they have the access they need. See our user guides for more details . As a sponsor, you are responsible for reviewing your apprentice's official records and reporting any discrepancies to SkilledTradesBC. We will send updated apprentice training transcripts to both sponsors and apprentices when: About 20 per cent of your apprentice's training time will be in the classroom, which includes both theoretical and practical assessments. Employer support is required to make it possible for apprentices to attend in-class technical training. This may include releasing apprentices from work for the duration of the class. Talk to your apprentice early on and work together to determine the best options for training times. The first level of technical training is generally scheduled one year after registering as an apprentice. If your apprentice has been working in the trade for some time, a shorter interval may be appropriate. We recommend scheduling technical training once a year throughout an apprenticeship to get a balance of theory and on-the-job practical experience. Classes fill up quickly, so encourage your apprentice to register as early as possible to secure a seat for technical training with a SkilledTradesBC-designated training provider . Once your apprentice has completed both their work-based and technical training and passed the certification exam, SkilledTradesBC will ask you to provide a Recommendation for Certification to attest that your apprentice is now working at the skill level of a certified journeyperson. Once we receive your recommendation, we will send you the certificate package to sign and present to your apprentice. If you decide not to recommend your apprentice for certification: Subject Matter Experts Help us develop and revise trades programs and exams by participating in workshops or webinars.

{"title": "Labour Mobility", "url": "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/labour-mobility", "content": "Labour Mobility If you are a certified tradesperson in another province, can you work in B.C.? If you hold a Certificate of Qualification from a trade board in Canada, SkilledTradesBC will recognize it. You will not have to re-certify or get a re-issued certificate. For certain trades, you will need to contact the local safety authority as they have additional licenses and requirements to work within B.C. Mutual Recognition of Qualifications SkilledTradesBC recognizes certificates issued by jurisdictional authorities in other Canadian provinces or territories. These authorities also recognize B.C. certificates. Recognition applies to individuals who are certified and in good standing in their trade with the appropriate provincial or territorial authority. These individuals have the same rights and obligations to practice the same occupation in all Canadian provinces and territories without significant additional training, experience, examinations or assessment of qualifications and without meeting a residency requirement. Rules for Mutual Recognition Mutual recognition only applies if you have your full certification or license. Trades/occupations must be the same or very similar in both jurisdictions. You must meet provincial or territorial Occupational Health and Safety requirements for your trade, which may require you to complete short courses or minor training specific to the jurisdiction. Regulated trades such as Electrician, Crane Operator, Security Alarm Installer, funeral trades and others may also require special licenses. (See Regulated Trades sections below.) Trades Available in Other Jurisdictions The following is a list of trades that are not offered in British Columbia but are available in the nearby provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. This list is part of British Columbia\u2019s commitment to the New West Partnership agreement to support greater mobility for apprentices. To learn more, please click on the links below.

Esthetician - Nail Technician Food and Beverage Person Framer Guest Services Representative Meatcutter Petroleum Installer Technician For additional information on how to participate in one of these programs, please contact the Saskatchewan Apprenticeship and Trade Certification Commission. Different Trade Names Across Jurisdictions Some trades go by different names across the country. It\u2019s a good idea to check and compare the B.C. trade name with that of the issuing jurisdiction (if you\u2019re coming to work in B.C. from elsewhere) or destination jurisdiction (if you\u2019re going to work in another Canadian jurisdiction). Regulated Trades in other Provinces and Territories Restrictions on the practice of trades occupations vary by province and territory, so it\u2019s best to contact the relevant jurisdictional authority to determine their requirements. Regulated Trades in B.C. There are two types of skilled trades in B.C.: regulated and non-regulated trades. A number of trades are regulated in B.C. for consumer protection and to ensure public health and safety. This means to perform work in these occupations you must be a registered apprentice with SkilledTradesBC or hold a certificate of qualification, and/or be licensed by the regulatory body for that trade. Although SkilledTradesBC sets standards and grants certificates for the skilled trades, there are other regulatory bodies in B.C. that control licensing and determine who can legally work in the trade. Examples of regulated trades in B.C. include, but are not limited to: Trade Regulatory Body Auto Glass ICBC Boilermaker Electrician Gasfitter Plumber Technical Safety BC Crane Operator WorkSafe BC Funeral Director Embalmer Business Practices - Consumer Protection Authority of BC Locksmith Security Alarm Installer Ministry of Justice Policing and Security Programs Apprentice Mobility If you are an apprentice looking for information on mobility between provinces, view our Apprentice Mobility page.

Due to service disruption from the BCGEU job action, processing may take longer than usual. How Exams are Marked Our exam marking process is built to be fair, accurate and reliable, ensuring timely delivery of exam results. Each multiple-choice exam question has only one correct answer. The Scantron answer sheets used for all multiple-choice exams are electronically scanned twice and scored by computer, minimizing errors and eliminating any discretion and subjectivity in grading. As a result, changes to exam scores are extremely rare. Exam Scoring Formula # of Correct Answers \u2044 # of Questions X 100 = X% Example 89\u2044 120 X 100 = 74.1% The pass mark for all exams is 70% (exam results are rounded up, so 69.5% and up is a pass). Your Exam Results Letter will have details of your mark on each topic area. Please note that the final mark is not an average of these topic marks, as each topic area may contain a different number of questions. To ensure the accuracy of exam results, we have robust quality control measures in place to detect and address any potential technical issues or anomalies.

{"title": "Start an Apprenticeship", "url": "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/start-an-apprenticeship", "content": "Start an Apprenticeship What is an apprenticeship? An apprenticeship is a combination of on-the-job training and classroom learning that leads to a skilled trade credential: Certificate of Apprenticeship (CoA) A provincial credential issued by SkilledTradesBC to a registered apprentice who has successfully completed all requirements of a trades training program. Certificate of Qualification (CoQ) A provincial credential issued by SkilledTradesBC, enabling you to work in a certain trade across B.C. Red Seal Endorsement (RSE) A nationally recognized credential issued by SkilledTradesBC for Red Seal trades, enabling you to work in a certain trade across Canada. How does an apprenticeship work? Most apprenticeships take an average of four years to complete, with 80 per cent of the training taking place on the worksite under the supervision of a certified journeyperson and 20 per cent in the classroom with a SkilledTradesBC-designated training provider. Work-based Training 80% The majority of your training is through practical, hands-on learning that happens at work with the support of your sponsor (who is often also your employer). Each trade has a mandatory number of work-based training hours required at each level and for certification. In-class Technical Training 20% The classroom is where you learn the technical knowledge to complement your work-based training. It must be completed through a SkilledTradesBC-designated training provider . Depending on the trade, there may be multiple levels of technical training required, and trade programs include Standard Level Exams. Certification After you\u2019ve completed both your work-based and in-class technical training, you will need to successfully write a certification exam and obtain a Recommendation of Certification from your sponsor to be officially certified! Step-By-Step Guide for Your Apprenticeship Journey Not sure where to start? Take our quiz and explore the best trades for you. Browse the specific trade pages and review the Program Profile (often near the middle of the trade page) carefully. Pay attention to details like how many levels of in-class technical training you need, the number of hours you\u2019ll need to work to get certified. Once you\u2019ve selected a trade, you may want to consider signing up for the trade\u2019s Foundation Program to gain some experience and familiarity with a trade before finding a sponsor for your apprenticeship. Every apprentice has both, and in most cases, the sponsor and employer are the same person or organization. The sponsor is responsible for helping you get opportunities to learn on the job and reporting how many work-based training hours you acquire; the employer hires you and pays for your work. Building a good working relationship with them is important to make sure the investment in your apprenticeship benefits everyone. Communication is key\u2014make sure that both you and your employer and/or sponsor understand your own responsibilities as well as the requirements for you to achieve certification. If anything is unclear, ask an Apprenticeship Advisor . Once you\u2019ve found a sponsor, register your apprenticeship by creating a SkilledTradesBC Portal account . Ensure that your sponsor has also created an account so that they can confirm your registration. The classroom is where you will pick up the technical knowledge to complement your work-based training. Make sure to register as early as possible to secure a seat for technical training with a SkilledTradesBC-designated training provider . Your trade program may be available at a school in your community or you may have to travel to relocate for a couple of weeks each year. Trades Training BC and EducationPlannerBC provide helpful search tools to find where your trade program is being offered across the province. We recommend scheduling your in-class technical training once a year throughout your apprenticeship to get a balance of theory and on-the-job practical experience. It\u2019s important to communicate with your employer about the best time to be away from work for in-class technical training. Ensure you apply for Employment Insurance (EI) to receive the benefits while attending in-class technical training. Sign into your SkilledTradesBC Portal account regularly to make sure the hours you have worked are being reported by your sponsor. We recommend sponsors to report your work-based training hours every 3-6 months. Please note that only sponsors are able to report your hours. Once you\u2019ve completed all levels of your in-class technical training, you will be tested on your entire apprenticeship through a certification exam. Your instructor will spend time on exam preparation , including a review of the theory from all levels. Take advantage of this, spend time to review your training materials , gather study resources and consider applying for an exam accommodation if you require additional support. If you do not get a pass mark of 70 per cent or higher, we provide rewrite opportunities to help you achieve certification. After you\u2019ve completed both your work-based and in-class technical training, including passing the certification exam, SkilledTradesBC will ask your sponsor and the certified journeyperson (or equivalent) who supervised you to provide a Recommendation for Certification (RFC) to confirm that you are working at the skill level of a certified journeyperson. Once we receive their recommendation, we will send the certificate package to your sponsor to sign and present, making you officially certified!

{"title": "Skilled Trades Certification Trades Designation Process", "url": "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/stc-trades-designation-process", "content": "Skilled Trades Certification Trades Designation Process We have an expanded mandate as SkilledTradesBC to ensure British Columbia has the skilled workforce to meet the demand for 83,000 more tradespeople over the next ten years. Part of this mandate includes implementing Skilled Trades Certification which will continue to build a diversified and sustainable skilled labour force through certification. On behalf of the Government of B.C., SkilledTradesBC is introducing a process to add more trades to the list of designated mandatory trades. Applications may come from B.C. businesses, labour organizations, industry associations, Indigenous organizations and communities that work in, or have an interest in, the trades. A maximum of ten trades are being assessed to move from the application to the detailed assessment phase. Final recommendations will be made to Government in early 2024. See the Timeline section below for more details. The application period is closed as of June 30. If you are interested in nominating a BC-recognized trade to be designated as an STC trade in the future, please contact us at stcapplication@skilledtradesbc.ca . Application Requirements There are two main components to the application: letters of support and industry perspective. Letters of Support Industry Perspective Applicants must submit two letters of support: one letter from a small-sized employer organization (1-49 employees), and one letter from a medium-sized employer organization (50-499 employees). Employers offering letters of support must employ tradespeople and/or sponsor apprentices. Applicants may also include two optional letters of support from unique constituency groups with an interest in this trade. Applicants will be asked to answer 7 questions to help SkilledTradesBC understand their organization\u2019s perspective on why the trade nominated in their application should be designated as a Skilled Trades Certification trade. Timeline Stage Application Period Application Review Detailed Assessment Dates May 11 - June 30, 2023 July 1 - August 31, 2023 September 1, 2023 - January 31, 2024 Objectives Applications to nominate trades as Skilled Trades Certification trades open to the public SkilledTradesBC reviews and prioritizes applications for detailed assessment. SkilledTradesBC completes a detailed assessment of prioritized trades, including implementation considerations. Note: This will form the basis for recommendations to the SkilledTradesBC Board of Directors and Government of B.C. Frequently Asked Questions The STC Trades Designation Application Forms will undergo a review which concludes on August 31, 2023. The applications that are identified to move forward then undergo a more detailed assessment which will take several months and result in a recommendation to government for consideration. Applicants will be notified if their nominated trade will progress to the detailed assessment phase in early September. It is important to note that SkilledTradesBC is using specific criteria to assess all trades nominated including identifying alignment within existing frameworks including if either a trade is: 1) currently regulated in BC, or 2) readily aligns to trades already identified as BC STC trades. SkilledTradesBC will also limit the number of trades that proceed to the detailed assessment phase to a maximum of ten (10). This is an open process and applications may come from B.C. businesses, labour organizations, industry associations, Indigenous organizations and communities that work in, or have an interest in, the trades. The application requires a minimum of two letters of support \u2013 one letter from a small-sized employer (1-49 employees) and one letter from a medium-sized employer (50-499 employees). Employers must employ tradespersons and/or sponsor apprentices. Applicants may also submit two additional letters optionally from other organizations such as Indigenous communities or training providers. A maximum of 10 trades will be selected to move from the application phase to the detailed assessment phase. The final trades will be announced by the Government of B.C. in spring 2024. Yes, each organization will need to complete a separate application for each trade nomination they make. If you know other organizations who are nominating a trade your organization is also interested in nominating, we encourage you to work together and consider writing a letter of support. Near the end of the STC Trades Designation process, SkilledTradesBC will be recommending up to 10 trades to our Board and the Ministry of Post-Secondary Education and Future Skills for consideration. There may be an opportunity to nominate additional trades in the future; however, no new applications will be accepted until the review and assessment phases conclude on the first round of applications and recommendations for STC designation have been submitted to government. If you are interested in nominating a BC-recognized trades for STC designation at a future date, please contact us for more information at stcapplication@skilledtradesbc.ca .

{"title": "Experienced Workers in STC (Compulsory) Trades", "url": "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/experienced-workers-stc-trades", "content": "Experienced Workers in STC Trades Experienced workers bring years of valuable knowledge and in-demand skills to the table, which is why we have created clear pathways for experienced workers in Skilled Trades Certification trades, also known as compulsory trades, to meet regulatory requirements. If you have over five years of practical experience in a Skilled Trades Certification trade but are not certified, you have two options: Apply for Temporary Authorization to continue working in your trade as a Trade Qualifier while preparing to get certified by writing and passing the certification exam. Apply for Temporary Authorization to continue working in your trade as an Uncertified Experienced Worker until December 2028, while planning to get off the tools. Who are Trade Qualifiers? Trade Qualifiers are uncertified tradespeople who have extensive experience (five or more years) who are looking to get certified without having to complete an apprenticeship program, by challenging the certification exam. See the application process below. Before you apply, please ensure: You have the required hours and scope of hands-on work experience in the trade. Your references can be contacted by phone to verify your work experience. If references cannot be contacted, it may result in your application being denied. You can schedule and pass your certification exam within 24 months of your application approval. Upon approval, you will be automatically issued a Temporary Authorization, allowing you to continue working in your trade while you are preparing to write and pass the certification exam.

You will be automatically placed into Level 4 of your trade and receive full credit for the required work-based training hours. You will then need to register for the program at a SkilledTradesBC-designated training provider , attend in-class technical training and pass the final exam in order to receive certification.

{"title": "Supplier Complaint Review Process", "url": "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/procurement/supplier-complaint-review-process", "content": "Supplier Complaint Process Overview SkilledTradesBC identified a need for a process to deal with issues arising from its procurement processes. The procurement department aims to conduct its core business through processes that demonstrate fair, open and transparent public procurement and contracting practices and protection for all parties under the law. The procurement department will thoroughly investigate any complaints about the way SkilledTradesBC handles the tendering procedures or any other procurement-related matters. The procurement department developed a supplier complaint review process (SCRP) intended to provide access to a consistent, organized, fair and timely process to deal with supplier complaints concerning SkilledTradesBC's procurement process. The SCRP will carry out the analysis and reporting requirements in order to identify ways to make improvements to the procurement process. The SCRP is consistent with the Bid Protest Mechanism outlined in the applicable trade agreements (NWPTA, CFTA, CETA, WTO-GPA and CPTPP). The objective of the SCRP is to improve related and established policies and procedures to facilitate the relationship between SkilledTradesBC and suppliers. All information under this SCRP is subject to the Document Disposal Act and the access and privacy provisions of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act . Download the Vendor Complaint Form Procedures for the Supplier Complaint Review Process In the event of a potential procurement violation under NWPTA, CFTA or CETA, any \u201csupplier\u201d can invoke the Bid Protest mechanism to make a complaint directly against the public procuring authority. \u201cSupplier\u201d is defined as any \u201cperson that provides or could provide goods or services\u201d in the context of a covered procurement. This process does not apply to issues related to supplier or SkilledTradesBC performance or conduct during an agreement between parties. Those issues are to be dealt with through the dispute resolution processes identified in the agreement. There is a period allowed for raising complaints. Procurement Contact Procurement Manager 800-8100 Granville Avenue Richmond, BC Canada V6Y 3T6 Email: procurement@skilledtradesbc.ca Registering a Complaint Suppliers who wish to submit complaints must give the procuring authority the opportunity to resolve the complaint. Most complaints can be dealt with quickly and successfully by contacting the Procurement Contact who will initiate an internal review. Suppliers must submit their complaints within 10 days after the day the supplier first knew (or reasonably should have known) that the procurement violated a rule under the trade agreement(s) relevant to the procurement being challenged. All complaints must be in writing and clearly state the grounds for the complaint. The complaint should be readable, clear and to the point, quoting sections of the law contravened, where possible. The complaint must be signed by the complainant. The complainant should be able to indicate the grounds for the complaint, and the anticipated remedy. The letter should be signed by an authorized person. A complaint initiates a 20-day consultation period during which the supplier and the procurement authority have the opportunity to resolve the complaint collaboratively. When these consultations are unsuccessful, the supplier may, within 14 days of the end of consultations, proceed with a written request to the relevant Trade Agreement Secretariat. Dismissing a Complaint The Procurement Contact will consider the merits of the complaint and may, at its discretion, dismiss a complaint on the grounds that: the complainant does not have sufficient interest in the subject matter of the complaint; or the complaint is not substantiated; or the complainant\u2019s intent is to delay the procurement process or execution of the agreement(s) due to matters unrelated to the procurement at hand; or at the same time as the complaint is received, the complainant has initiated legal proceedings, or has submitted a complaint to the Procurement Ombudsman, or engaged in another review process pertaining to the complaint. Where the Procurement Contact dismisses a complaint, SkilledTradesBC will inform the complainant and will state the reasons for refusing to undertake a review. A record of the dismissal of the complaint will be retained by the Procurement department. The Procurement Contact will consider all the circumstances relevant to the complaint including: the seriousness of any deficiency found in the procurement process; and whether the parties acted in good faith. Records and Documentation Documentation will be retained by the Procurement department, as required, to demonstrate responsiveness to the supplier and compliance with SkilledTradesBC\u2019s policies.

{"title": "Level Challengers in STC (Compulsory) Trades", "url": "https://skilledtradesbc.ca/level-challengers-stc-trades", "content": "Level Challengers in STC Trades Who are Level Challengers? Level Challengers are uncertified tradespeople who have some practical experience in their trade (between one to four years), who are looking to challenge a level exam to enter the apprenticeship program at the appropriate level. See the application process below . How To Assess Your Level First, determine your level based on the work-based training hours you have completed. The required hours for each level are the same for all trades under Skilled Trades Certification. Level 1: 1,800 hours (approx. 1 year) Level 2: 3,600 hours (approx. 2-3 years) Level 3: 5,400 hours (approx. 3-5 years) Next, fill out the self-assessment form * for your trade. These forms allow you to assess your knowledge of each of the areas of competencies taught in the particular level of technical training. The questions are also weighted similarly to the exam written at the end of each technical training level. Your results will highlight areas of strength and areas where you may need further knowledge or practical experience. If you score 65% or above, you may be ready for the selected level exam. If you score 64% or below, you should seek further training or support, or re-take the self-assessment at a lower level. * Challenging the level exam for Powerline Technician is not available. Powerline Technician workers will need to either register as an apprentice and work towards certification or challenge the certification exam to become certified. Steps to Challenge a Level Exam for Skilled Trades Certification trades The following steps only apply for those challenging a designated Skilled Trades Certification (compulsory) trade. To challenge a level exam for other trades, visit the Challenge a Level Exam page . To start, you will need to meet the following minimum work-based training hour requirements to be eligible to challenge each level exam: Level 1: 1,800 hours (approximately 1 year) Level 2*: 3,600 hours (approximately 2-3 years) Level 3*: 5,400 hours (approximately 3-5 years) *You must pass each level exam in sequence to ensure you have the foundational knowledge needed for advanced training. Complete the self-assessment for your trade and level based on your work-based training hours to assess your knowledge of each of the areas of competencies taught in technical training. You can challenge higher levels directly if you meet the minimum required work-based training hour requirements and pass the self-assessment form for that level. Your results will highlight areas of strength and where you may need further knowledge or practical experience. If you score 65 per cent or above, you may be ready for the selected level exam. If you score 64 per cent or below, you should seek further training or support, or re-take the self-assessment at a lower level. Download and save a PDF copy of your results. Before submitting your application, you must first register as an apprentice by creating a SkilledTradesBC Portal account . Complete and submit the level placement exam application form with a copy of your self-assessment results to customerservice@skilledtradesbc.ca . The application form must be signed by your sponsor/employer or a certified journeyperson to endorse your level of experience and knowledge of the trade. Incomplete applications will not be processed and will be returned to you. There is no fee for level exams. SkilledTradesBC will review your application to determine whether you meet the requirements to challenge the level exam. The typical processing time is approximately 10 to 15 business days. If approved: SkilledTradesBC will schedule the level exam and you will receive an email notification confirming the details. If the exam date requested is unavailable, we will schedule you for the next available date at your chosen location. If denied: You will receive an email notification with further instructions on next steps. Visit the Exam Study and Support section for resources to help you succeed You have a maximum of two attempts to achieve the required 70 per cent passing score on your level exam. For more information on exam rewrites, see the Exam Rewrites page . After passing your level exam, your profile on the Portal will show your apprenticeship journey and reflect the level you have achieved, including credit for the relevant technical training and work-based training hours. Make sure to register as early as possible to secure a seat for technical training with a SkilledTradesBC-designated training provider . Your trade program may be available at a school in your community or you may have to travel to relocate for a couple of weeks each year. Trades Training BC and EducationPlannerBC provide helpful search tools to find where your trade program is being offered across the province. We recommend scheduling your in-class technical training once a year throughout your apprenticeship to get a balance of theory and on-the-job practical experience. It\u2019s important to communicate with your employer about the best time to be away from work for in-class technical training. You are now on your apprenticeship journey to certification!

With more than 83,000 job openings expected in the next decade, there has never been a better time to join the skilled trades. While British Columbia has a strong and effective trades training system that offers multiple pathways for individuals to achieve certification, it has not had compulsory trades for two decades. Skilled Trades Certification looks to standardize the training apprentices receive and works to level the playing field, helping to attract a diverse workforce. Are You Impacted? Skilled Trades Certification (Compulsory) Trades These trades were chosen because they are in high demand, contain relatively low numbers of uncertified workers, and are regulated by other regulators for safety and workmanship. This allows for the least disruption to workers and employers as we transition to a Skilled Trades Certification system over the coming years. As part of SkilledTradesBC\u2019s broadened responsibility for trades training and set out in the Skilled Trades BC Act , Skilled Trades Certification has been implemented for the following trades: Employers, Experienced Workers, Level Challengers If you have between 1-4 years of experience in your trade, you can become a Level Challenger, putting you on the fast track to become a certified journeyperson. If you have over 5 years of work experience in your trade, you can apply to either become a Trade Qualifier or an Uncertified Experienced Worker. Learn how Skilled Trades Certification can be good for your business and what your responsibilities are as an employer. Contact an Advisor Our team is here to support and provide guidance. Reach out to a Certification Advisor directly. Additional Resources In addition to the provincial and federal supports available to registered employers and apprentices, we have enhanced our Skilled Trades Certification supports. Join one of our information sessions to speak with our team. Downloadable resources including our brochures and webinar recordings. Frequently Asked Questions There will be no impact to registered apprentices and certified journeypeople. However, unregistered workers who are currently in one of the Skilled Trades Certification (compulsory) trades will have to be either registered as an apprentice with an employer sponsor, a certified journeyperson, or have applied to become a Trade Qualifier or Uncertified Experienced Worker. Click here to find out what actions you need to take. You will need to ensure that your workers are either a registered apprentice, a certified journeyperson or registered as a Trade Qualifier or Uncertified Experienced Worker with SkilledTradesBC. You are also responsible for ensuring adequate on-the-job learning and supervision by maintaining a maximum ratio of 2:1 apprentices to journeyperson. We\u2019ve added a new Employer Workforce Submission on our Portal to help with recording all of this information. More information on Skilled Trades Certification, the pathways to certification and your role as an Employer can be found on this page . Our Advisors are here to help understand your unique situation and support you on the pathway to meeting the requirements. Contact us by filling out this form and we\u2019ll get back to you as soon as possible. If an apprentice wants to attain certification in a skilled trade, they are required to register with a sponsor to receive on-the-job training done by certified journeypersons. A supervision ratio is a limit on the number of apprentices a journeyperson can train at a time. For electrical and mechanical Skilled Trades Certification (compulsory) trades, the supervision ratio of apprentice to journeyperson is 2:1 (two to one). A 2:1 apprentice to journeyperson supervision ratio helps ensure that apprentices are able to get the right level of training and experience they need to become qualified workers, who in turn are able to support businesses and the needs of British Columbians. Learn more about supervision ratios on our employer page . If you have any further questions about meeting the supervision ratio or how it might affect you, please sign in to the Portal to complete the Employer Workforce Submission and a Skilled Trades Certification Advisor will reach out to support. SkilledTradesBC has introduced a new Employer Workforce Submission on our customer portal for all employers of workers in Skilled Trades Certification (compulsory) trades to provide information about their workforce. The information gathered will be used to identify workers and employers in Skilled Trades Certification (compulsory) trades, help us understand more about their existing workforce and provide assistance to those who may need our support in meeting the new requirements. For example, if an employer employs unregistered workers, our Certification Advisor team will reach out to help get these workers registered and on the path to certification. Up-to-date information on Skilled Trades Certification (compulsory) trades in our province will also help us advance and enhance B.C.\u2019s valuable certification system. Employers will be asked to provide the following information: Scope of work refers to general activities, tasks or functions carried out by workers in their respective trade. It is linked and driven by the definition in each trade profile established for our apprenticeship programs , which is consistent with the National Red Seal Occupational Standard definition. Details of the scope of work of Skilled Trades Certification (compulsory) trades can be found here . A Temporary Authorization issued by SkilledTradesBC authorizes an uncertified worker to continue to work in a Skilled Trades Certification trade for a certain period of time. Once you submit an application as a Trade Qualifier or Uncertified Experienced Worker and receive approval, you will automatically be issued a Temporary Authorization. Our goal is to support employers and individuals in meeting these new requirements. Signing up for the SkilledTradesBC Portal and starting your application to become a Trade Qualifier or Uncertified Experienced Worker. For more information on Temporary Authorizations, visit this page . Skilled Trades Certification, also known as compulsory trades, is now in effect for electrical and mechanical trades. Workers in these trades need to be registered as an apprentice or a certified journeyperson and employers need to ensure adequate on-the-job learning and supervision by maintaining the 2:1 apprentice to journeyperson ratio.
